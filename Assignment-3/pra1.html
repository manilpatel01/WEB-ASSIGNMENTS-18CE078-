	<h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>

	<p>
		<font size="4">Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer
			systems use to perform
			a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen
			as a subset
			of artificial intelligence.</font>
	</p>

	<p><b>There are two types of Machine Learning
			<ol>
				<li>Supervised Learning</li>
				<li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
			</ol></b>
	</p>

	<p><b>What is Supervised Machine Learning?</b></p>
	<p>Supervised Learning is the one, where you can consider the learning is guided by a teacher. We have a dataset
		which acts as a teacher and its role is to train the model or the machine. Once the model gets trained it can
		start making
		a
		prediction or decision when new data is given to it.</p>
	<p><b>What is Unsupervised Machine Learning?</b></p>
	<p>The model learns through observation and finds structures in the data. Once the model is given a dataset, it
		automatically finds patterns and relationships in the dataset by creating clusters in it. What it cannot do is
		add
		labels to the cluster, like it cannot say this a group of apples or mangoes, but it will separate all the apples
		from
		mangoes.

		Suppose we presented images of apples, bananas and mangoes to the model, so what it does, based on some patterns
		and
		relationships it creates clusters and divides the dataset into those clusters. Now if a new data is fed to the
		model, it
		adds it to one of the created clusters.</p>
